# Hi, I'm Benjamin!

I'm a French front-end developer with a taste for simple stacks, consistent designs and resilient techs. I'm also a map enthusiast and have been involved in many geo-spatial projects.

I'm currently working at [PASQAL](https://pasqal.com), previously [CARTO](https://carto.com) and [Qwant maps](https://www.qwant.com/maps/).
